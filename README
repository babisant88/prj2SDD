The program is an implementation of the algorithm proposed in the attached paper.

The algorithm finds the nearest Symmetric Diagonally Dominant matrix (SDD) 
to a given matrix A with nonnegative diagonal, in the Frobenius norm i.e. the following least-squares problem:

	min ||A-X||   s.t X Îµ SDD
 	 X

In order to build the program just run make.

In order to run the progrma type in the command line %prj2SDD <A> <n>

, where A is the given matrix and n its dimension.
